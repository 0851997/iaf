How to use this with Eclipse (juno)

Via Eclipse Marketplace (Help -> Eclipse Marketplace):

0. install egit if not yet available (it is default available on newer eclipse's)
1. install 'Maven Integration for Eclipse'  (m2e).
2. install 'm2e-egit' via the 'm2e Marketplace'. The only way I can
come up with the find the m2e market place is: File ->Import -> Maven
-> Check out Maven Projects From SCM -> Find more SCM connectors in
the 'm2e Marketplace'. Don't actually import this way, because it
won't let you select a branch.
3. install 'Maven Integration for Eclipse WTP (Incubation)' m2e-wtp.

Then
1. start a new eclipse workspace
2. close Welcome, open 'Git Repository Exploring' perspective (with the little plus near the upper right corner)
3. Clone a  git repository
4. URI: git@github.com:ibissource/iaf.git
5. select mavenize branch
6. Choose directory.
7. Wait until pull from git is ready
8. Right click 'iaf' and choose 'Import maven projects'
9. Select all

The work space will now be build.

Via the Java EE perspective you can create a tomcat server.

The example-webapp can be run in this server.
